Directory hierarchy.

- There are public and private directories at the top level - where public
plugins are free to be shared by all while private ones could be monetized.
- Under these we have split the plugins based on the OS. Examples ios_xr,
ios_xe and so on. Under each OS we've split them as PI and a set of platforms
supported by the OS.
- Under this, we're envisioning a flat hierarchy of various plugins under
their respective folders: parse, query, result. This provides the ability for
each team to manage their plugins seprately.
- The files themselves are don't have any naming requirements at this point.
  Consider naming them based on their functionality so that they're
  recognizable.
- In a given directory, obviously there can't be any duplicate files.
- You can use the GUI to add a new Plugin file under the choosen OS/Platform.
  The path should be specified as pi/<plugin_type>/<plugin_name.py> or
  <your_pd>/<plugin_type>/<plugin_name.py>.
- If you want to create a new OS, Platform, then create those directories
